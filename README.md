# OOP_Cpp_SnakeGame
A simple, console-based snake game that demonstrates simple OOP techniques and utilises a variety of C++ libraries.

NOTE: I am aware that the naming conventions utilised aren't consistent (some camelCase and some using underscores). Code will be modified and comments/ descriptions will be added in due time.
